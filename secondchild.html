        <p>Oreofe Jaye, my younger sister, is a vibrant and lively character who keeps our family on its toes. Though she’s 13 years old (she likes to joke she’s still 12), she’s already full of personality. Born on September 7, she has a knack for finding fun in everything she does. One of her favorite pastimes is sneaking into everyone’s wardrobe to try on their clothes, always curious to see how she looks in something different. It’s a running joke in our house that if something’s missing from your closet, Oreofe is probably the culprit.</p>
        <p>Despite her active nature, Oreofe has a love for sleep that’s unmatched. You can catch her napping in the most random places and times, as if she’s always trying to catch up on rest. But when the night falls, she transforms into a bit of a night owl, creeping around the house to snack and watch videos on her phone. She also has a habit of borrowing my charger without asking, which is a small but persistent source of sibling rivalry.</p>
        <p>Oreofe’s mischievous side shows up now and then, especially when she’s up to something she shouldn’t be. Yet, she’s also deeply interested in skincare and loves talking about the latest products and routines she’s discovered. Her enthusiasm for self-care is impressive for her age, and she’s always eager to share her tips, even if we’re not always as interested as she is. Despite her occasional naughtiness, Oreofe’s unique mix of humor, curiosity, and caring makes her a truly special sister, and life would be a lot less interesting without her around.</p>
